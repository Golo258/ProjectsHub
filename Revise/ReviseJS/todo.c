Description
    Create a To-Do List application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application should also save the list of tasks in LocalStorage so that the list persists even after the page is refreshed.

    Requirements
        HTML
            Create a simple HTML page with the following elements:

            A text input field for entering new tasks.
            A button labeled "Add Task" to add new tasks to the list.
            A list (e.g., <ul>) to display the tasks.
    JavaScript

        Adding Tasks: 
            Write a function that adds a new task to the list when the "Add Task" button is clicked.
        Deleting Tasks:
            Write a function that deletes a task from the list when the "Delete" button next to the task is clicked.
        Marking as Completed:
            Write a function that marks a task as completed (e.g., by striking through the text) when the task is clicked.
        Saving to LocalStorage: 
            Write a function that saves the current state of the task list to LocalStorage whenever a task is added, deleted, or marked as completed.
        Loading from LocalStorage:
            Write a function that loads the task list from LocalStorage when the page is loaded.
